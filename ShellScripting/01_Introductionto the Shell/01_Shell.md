### What is a Shell in Linux?

In Linux, a **shell** is a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with the operating system by entering commands. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the kernel, interpreting and executing the commands you input.

There are different types of shells available in Linux, such as:

* **Bash** (Bourne Again Shell): The most common shell.
* **Zsh** (Z Shell): Known for its features like better autocompletion and themes.
* **Fish** (Friendly Interactive Shell): Focuses on user-friendly features.
* **Sh** (Bourne Shell): The original shell that most Linux shells are based on.
* **Csh** (C Shell): Similar to the C programming language syntax.

### How to Find Your Current Shell

To determine which shell you're using in your terminal, you can use one of the following commands:

1. **`echo $SHELL`**
   This will show you the path of the currently running shell (e.g., `/bin/bash` or `/bin/zsh`).

2. **`ps -p $$`**
   This shows the process ID (PID) of your current shell. The output will show the name of the shell, like this:

   ```
   PID TTY          TIME CMD
   12345 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
   ```

   Here, `bash` is your shell.

3. **`echo $0`**
   This also returns the name of the shell that is running.

### Parent and Child Shells

* **Parent Shell**: The shell that is running initially when you log in or when you open a terminal session. It's the original shell from which other processes might be spawned. If you're working within a terminal window, your current session is most likely the parent shell.

* **Child Shell**: When you run a new shell within the parent shell (like running a subshell), that new shell is considered a **child shell**. Child shells are created when you run a command that invokes another shell, such as:

  * Running a script or program that starts a new shell.
  * Using commands like `bash`, `zsh`, or `sh` inside your current shell session.

  The child shell inherits most of the environment from the parent shell, but can have its own settings, environment variables, and running processes.

You can check the parent shell process ID (PID) by running `echo $$`, and then you can use `ps -p <PID>` to see the details of the parent shell.

**Example**: If you start a new shell by typing `bash` in the terminal, the new bash process becomes the child shell, and the original shell you started from is the parent.

Certainly! In Linux, the `shlvl` (Shell Level) is an environment variable that indicates the **depth of nested shells**. It's used to track how many times a new shell has been spawned within another shell.

### What is `shlvl`?

* The `shlvl` variable is automatically set by the shell each time a new shell is started.
* Its value starts at `1` in the parent shell.
* Each time a new shell is spawned (i.e., when you run a command like `bash` or `zsh` within a shell), the `shlvl` is incremented by 1.

So, if you're in a shell and you start another shell within it, the `shlvl` will increase. If you're in the parent shell, `shlvl` will be `1`. In a child shell spawned by the parent, `shlvl` will be `2`, and so on.

### How to Check the `shlvl`

You can check the current `shlvl` with:

```bash
echo $SHLVL
```

This will print the current nesting level of the shell.

### Example

1. **In your first shell (the parent shell):**

   ```bash
   echo $SHLVL
   1
   ```

2. **If you run a new shell (e.g., `bash`):**

   ```bash
   bash
   echo $SHLVL
   2
   ```

3. **Running another shell inside the new shell:**

   ```bash
   bash
   echo $SHLVL
   3
   ```

### Why is `shlvl` Useful?

* **Tracking nested shells**: It can help you understand how many nested shells you have running. This can be particularly useful for debugging and scripting.
* **Preventing runaway nesting**: If a shell script or command accidentally spawns too many shells, it could lead to excessive memory use or an infinite loop. You can use `shlvl` to detect such problems.

### Resetting `shlvl`

If you want to reset the `shlvl` value back to `1` in a child shell, you can do so by manually setting the value:

```bash
export SHLVL=1
```

This can be useful if you want to break out of excessive shell nesting without actually closing and reopening the terminal.
