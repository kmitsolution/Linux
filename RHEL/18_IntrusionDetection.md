Intrusion Detection and Prevention is essential for maintaining the security of a system. In this context, we'll cover tools like **fail2ban**, **rkhunter**, **logwatch**, and **journalctl**, which help monitor and prevent unauthorized access or malicious activities on a system.

### 1. **Fail2Ban (Intrusion Prevention)**
Fail2Ban is a popular tool for preventing brute-force attacks by monitoring log files for repeated failed login attempts and blocking the IP addresses involved.

#### **Installation of Fail2Ban:**
On a RHEL/CentOS system, install `fail2ban` using the following commands:

```bash
sudo yum install fail2ban -y
```

#### **Basic Configuration of Fail2Ban:**
1. **Create a copy of the default configuration:**

   ```bash
   sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
   ```

   The `.local` file is for custom configurations. Never modify the `.conf` file directly because it will be overwritten during updates.

2. **Configure fail2ban:**

   Edit the `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local` file to enable protection for specific services like SSH, HTTP, etc.

   ```bash
   sudo vi /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
   ```

   Example configuration for SSH protection:
   ```ini
   [sshd]
   enabled = true
   port = ssh
   logpath = /var/log/secure
   maxretry = 3
   bantime = 600
   findtime = 600
   ```

   - **enabled**: Enable the jail for SSH.
   - **maxretry**: Number of failed login attempts allowed before banning the IP.
   - **bantime**: How long (in seconds) the IP is banned.
   - **findtime**: Time window in seconds in which the failed attempts are counted.

3. **Start and enable Fail2Ban:**
   After configuring, start and enable `fail2ban` to run at boot time:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start fail2ban
   sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
   ```

4. **Check Fail2Ban status:**

   To check if Fail2Ban is working correctly, use:

   ```bash
   sudo fail2ban-client status
   ```

   For detailed information on the SSH jail:

   ```bash
   sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
   ```

   You should see the number of banned IPs and other relevant information.

### 2. **rkhunter (Rootkit Hunter)**
`rkhunter` is a tool that scans for rootkits and other potential security threats.

#### **Installation of rkhunter:**
To install `rkhunter` on RHEL/CentOS, use the following commands:

```bash
sudo yum install rkhunter -y
```

#### **Usage of rkhunter:**

1. **Update rkhunter databases:**

   First, update the `rkhunter` database to ensure the latest rootkit signatures are available:

   ```bash
   sudo rkhunter --update
   ```

2. **Scan for rootkits:**

   After the database is updated, you can perform a system scan to check for rootkits:

   ```bash
   sudo rkhunter --check
   ```

3. **View scan results:**
   After the scan completes, it will provide a report indicating any suspicious files or rootkits detected. It will also provide recommendations on how to fix any issues it finds.

4. **Schedule regular scans:**

   It’s a good practice to run `rkhunter` periodically. You can schedule a cron job to run `rkhunter` automatically on a regular basis.

   Example cron job to run `rkhunter` every week:

   ```bash
   sudo crontab -e
   ```

   Add the following line to run the scan every Sunday at midnight:

   ```bash
   0 0 * * SUN /usr/bin/rkhunter --check --skip-keypress
   ```

### 3. **Log Monitoring with Logwatch**
Logwatch is a log analysis tool that summarizes and reports information from system logs.

#### **Installation of Logwatch:**
To install Logwatch, use the following command:

```bash
sudo yum install logwatch -y
```

#### **Basic Configuration:**

Logwatch is configured by default to check various logs, but you can configure it to monitor specific logs or change the report frequency.

1. **Edit Logwatch configuration:**

   Edit `/etc/logwatch/conf/logwatch.conf` to adjust settings such as the frequency and output format:

   ```bash
   sudo vi /etc/logwatch/conf/logwatch.conf
   ```

   Example:
   ```ini
   MailTo = root
   Range = yesterday
   Detail = High
   Service = All
   ```

   - **MailTo**: Specifies the email recipient of the log report.
   - **Range**: Specifies the time range of logs to review (e.g., `yesterday`, `today`, `all`).
   - **Detail**: The level of detail (e.g., `Low`, `Medium`, `High`).

2. **Run Logwatch manually:**

   To generate a report immediately:

   ```bash
   sudo logwatch --detail High --range 'yesterday' --service All --mailto root
   ```

3. **Schedule Logwatch Reports:**

   You can schedule Logwatch to send reports automatically using cron. Add the following cron job to run daily at 1 AM:

   ```bash
   sudo crontab -e
   ```

   Add:
   ```bash
   0 1 * * * /usr/sbin/logwatch --output mail --mailto root --detail high
   ```

---

### 4. **Log Monitoring with `journalctl`**
`journalctl` is a powerful command-line tool for querying logs from `systemd`. It helps in monitoring various logs for system activity, including potential intrusion attempts.

#### **Basic Usage of `journalctl`:**

1. **View the system logs:**

   To view all logs from `journalctl`:

   ```bash
   sudo journalctl
   ```

2. **View logs for a specific service:**

   To view logs for a specific service (e.g., `sshd`):

   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u sshd
   ```

3. **Real-time log monitoring:**

   To watch logs in real-time:

   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -f
   ```

4. **Search logs for specific keywords:**

   If you're searching for failed login attempts (e.g., looking for "Failed password" messages in `sshd` logs):

   ```bash
   sudo journalctl | grep "Failed password"
   ```

5. **View logs for a specific time range:**

   You can filter logs by date and time using the `--since` and `--until` flags. For example, to view logs from today:

   ```bash
   sudo journalctl --since today
   ```

6. **View logs with priority level:**

   If you're only interested in critical logs, you can filter by log priority:

   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -p err
   ```

   This will show logs with a priority of "error" or higher.
