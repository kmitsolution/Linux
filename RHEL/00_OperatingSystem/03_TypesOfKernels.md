## Types of Kernel

Different operating systems have their own kernels, each designed to work with the specific architecture and requirements of that OS. Common kernel types include:

### Monolithic Kernel: 
All essential OS services are combined into a single, large kernel. Examples include the Linux kernel and traditional UNIX kernels.

### Microkernel: 
The kernel is minimal, providing only basic services like process scheduling and inter-process communication. Additional services are implemented as separate user-space processes. Examples include the MINIX kernel and some real-time operating systems.
### Hybrid Kernel: 
A combination of monolithic and microkernel concepts, providing a balance between performance and modularity. Windows and macOS are examples of OSes with hybrid kernels.

The kernel is essential to the functioning of an OS, and its design significantly impacts the OS's performance, security, and capabilities.
